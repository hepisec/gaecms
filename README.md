This is a sample Java application for the Google App Engine.

I did a talk at the Magdeburger Developer Days conference on this application.

I've written a sample Java application for the Google App Engine, where you can host small applications entirely for free. Maybe I'll find the time to do a write-up, as my talk was not recorded.

But all the code and presentation are available online:
